Your goal is to read a 68-word text from the input and then print it to the screen backwards. Individual words do not have to be spelled backwards, but rather your program should print out the last word first, then the second-to-last word, etc. No word has more than 40 characters.


#include <stdio.h>
//prototype fucns

int main(void) {
    //variable assignment
	char text[68][41];
	int i;
	
	//for loop to scan in the words
	for(i=0;i<68;i++){
	    scanf("%s",text[i]);
	}
	
	//for loop to print the words in reverse
	/*
	use the number of words as a start counter and just print the reverse so
	text[67 - i] = 67th word == "The
	*/
	
	for(i=0;i<68;i++){
	    printf("%s ",text[67 - i]);
	}
	
	
	return 0;
}
